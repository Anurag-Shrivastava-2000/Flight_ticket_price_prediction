# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts flight ticket prices using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset contains over 300,000 flight records with various features such as airline, source/destination cities, stops, travel class, and more. The final model is a Gradient Boosting Regressor that achieved an R² score of **0.97** on the test set.
